      <p>
        I'm Pierrick Deniel, a consultant specializing in technical SEO and AI-powered automation.
        For several years, I've been helping businesses optimize their online presence and automate
        their workflows.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My journey started in web development before gradually specializing in technical SEO.
        This dual expertise gives me a complete view of both technical and marketing challenges on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, I've become passionate about automation and artificial intelligence,
        exploring how these technologies can transform the way we work.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical SEO</strong> — Audits, performance optimization, information architecture, content strategy</li>
        <li><strong>AI Automation</strong> — Automated workflows with N8N, Make, and AI API integrations (OpenAI, Claude)</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting</strong> — Personalized guidance for marketing and technical teams</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in simplicity and efficiency. The best solutions are often the simplest ones.
        My approach is to deeply understand needs before proposing tailored solutions—never one-size-fits-all.
      </p>
